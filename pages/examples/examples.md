The sidebar lets you browse through a wide varity of example scripts from many different MTEX users. All these scripts are hosted at [Github](https://github.com/mtex-toolbox/examples). If you have any MTEX script to share, e.g., because it is part of a published paper, we would be extremely happy to put it on this page.
