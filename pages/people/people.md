                    <b>Ralf Hielscher</b>
                    invented MTEX in 2007 by implementing the pole figure to ODF inversion
                    algorithm and leads since than the development.

                    joined the MTEX team in 2008 as a PhD student of
                    Rene Heilbronner, Basel. Since than he answered hundreds of questions in the
                    MTEX forum. R체diger spends much afford in continuously improving the EBSD
                    and grain analysis functionalities in MTEX.
