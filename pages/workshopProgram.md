## Monday

Lecture 1: _*Matlab Basics and conception of the MTEX Toolbox*_
(Ralf)
  
 - demonstrated at the example of vector3d
 - vector3d: definition, import, operations, representation, spherical projections, plotting

Lecture 2: _*Crystal Lattices*_
(Ralf)

  - direct, reciprocal coordinates, zone equation, crystal shape

Lecture 3: _*Rotations*_
(Ralf)

  - definition, operations, representations, visualization (no quaternions :))

Exercise 1:
(Ralf)


## Tuesday

Lecture 4: _*Crystal Symmetries*_

Lecture 5: _*Orientations*_
  
  - definition, pole figures, inverse pole figures

Lecture 6: _*Density Estimation, ODF, Pole Figures, texture strength*_

Exercise 2:


## Wednesday

Lecture 7: _*EBSD*_
  (Rüdiger)
  
  - data import,
  - select by phase
  - pole figures, inverse pole figures, ipf maps
  - different color keys
  - alignment of the reference system
  - select by properties, internal representation
  - gridify

Lecture 8: _*Grains*_
  (Rüdiger / Ralf)
  
  - the segmentation algorithm
  - relationship grains <-> EBSD
  - grain properties,
  - shape properties, ellipse fitting, convex hull
  - selecting grains

Exercise 3: X-ray pole figures + EBSD 
  (Luiz)
  - with data from same sample -> Luiz quartz mylonite  
  - I think it is very important to explain here a lot about aligning the reference system
  - therefore a combined example helps a lot the understanding

Exercise 4: Introduction from grain properties - EBSD 
  (Rüdiger)
  - I think ebsd + grain is so important that we should have 2 exercises here 
  

## Thursday

Lecture 9: _*Misorientations*_
  (Ralf)
  
  - definition, visualization
  - phase transitions
  - misorientation axis, angle, distribution
  - KAM, GOS
  - misorientation regions

Lecture 10: _*Grain boundaries*_
  (Rüdiger)
  - properties
  - visualization
  - smoothing
  - tilt / twist
  - boundaries <-> grains <-> EBSD

Lecture 11: _*Plastic and elastic deformation*_
  - stress / strain / deformation tensors
  - slip systems
  - Schmid Factor
  - dislocationSystems
  - the GND
  - m-prime ?

Exercise 5:
  - mostly grain boundaries ?
  (Rüdiger)
  
## Friday

Lecture 12: _*ODF Reconstruction from XRD*_ (Ralf)

  - Data import
  - Plot and modifiy
  - Ghost effect and ghost correction
  - ODF estimation

Lecture 13: _*Tensorial properties*_

  - Wave Velocities

Exercise 5: _*Tensorial properties*_
  (Luiz)
  - piezoeletricity and seismic properties
