-,

-, and 
  {% include inline_image.html file="S2FunApproximationInterpolation_eq17119888974628994297.png" %}
-component of the nodes and the function value in the fourth column.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
data = importdata(fullfile(mtexDataPath, 'vector3d', 'smiley.csv'));
nodes = vector3d(data.data(:,1:3)')';
f = data.data(:,4);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Note that if you don't have the the nodes and function values stored convieniently in a Matlab-file, you can alway use the <a href="vector3d.load"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">load</code></a> function of the class <a href="vector3d.vector3d"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector3d</code></a>. Next, we can make a scatter plot to see, what we a dealing with.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
scatter(nodes, f, 'upper');
{% endhighlight %}
<center>
{% include inline_image.html file="S2FunApproximationInterpolation_01.png" %}
</center><p>Now, we want to find a function which coincides with the given function values in the nodes reasonably well.</p><h2 id="4">Interpolation</h2><p>The idea of the first approach is fairly simple. We create a function which has <b>exaclty</b> the value of the given data in the nodes. But we still have to decide what happens inbetween these nodes. For that, we linearly interpolate between them, similarly as Matlat plots a one-dimensional function</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
plot(rand(10,1), '.-')
{% endhighlight %}
<center>
{% include inline_image.html file="S2FunApproximationInterpolation_02.png" %}
</center><p>With some mathematics we can lift this concept to the sphere. This is done by the <a href="vector3d.interp"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interp</code></a> command of the class <a href="vector3d.vector3d"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector3d</code></a> when the argument <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'linear'</code> is given</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
sFTri = interp(nodes, f, 'linear');
{% endhighlight %}
<p>To see that we realy have the exact function values, we can evaluate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sFTri</code> of type <a href="S2FunTri.S2FunTri"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S2FunTri</code></a> and compare it with the original data values.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
norm(eval(sFTri, nodes)-f)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight plaintext %}
ans =
   4.3048e-15

{% endhighlight %}
<p>Indeed, the error is within machine precision. Now we can work with the function defined on the whole sphere. We can, for instance, plot it</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
contourf(sFTri, 'upper');
{% endhighlight %}
<center>
{% include inline_image.html file="S2FunApproximationInterpolation_03.png" %}
</center><p>That does not look like the happy smiley face we had in mind. There are other variants to fill the gaps between the data nodes, still preserving the interpolation property, which may improve the result. But if we don't restrict ourselfs to the given function values in the nodes, we have more freedom, which can be seen in the case of approximation.</p><h2 id="10">Approximation</h2><p>In contrast to interpolation we are now not restricted to the function values in the nodes but still want to keep the error reasonably small. One way to achieve this is to approximate it with a series of spherical harmonics. We don't take as many spherical harmonics as there are nodes, such that we are in the overdetermined case. In that way we don't have a chance of getting the error in the nodes zero but hope for a smoother approximation. This can be achieved by the <a href="vector3d.interp"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interp</code></a> command of the class <a href="vector3d.vector3d"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vector3d</code></a> when the argument <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'harmnicApproximation'</code></p>
{% highlight matlab %}
sF = interp(nodes, f, 'harmonicApproximation');
contourf(sF, 'upper');
{% endhighlight %}
<center>
{% include inline_image.html file="S2FunApproximationInterpolation_04.png" %}
</center><p>Plotting this function, we can immidiately see, that we have a much smoother function. But one has to keep in mind that the error in the data nodes is not zero as in the case of interpolation.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
norm(eval(sF, nodes)-f)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight plaintext %}
ans =
    0.0572

{% endhighlight %}
<p>But this may not be of great importance like in the case of function approximation from noisy function values, where we don't know the exact function values anyways.</p><p>The strategy underlying the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interp(...,'harmonicApproximation')</code>-command to obtain such an approximation works via spherical harmonics (<a href="S2FunHarmonicRepresentation">Basics of spherical harmonics</a>). For that, we seek for so-called Fourier-coefficients 
  {% include inline_image.html file="S2FunApproximationInterpolation_eq04709227244918925271.png" %}
 such that</p><p>
  {% include inline_image.html file="S2FunApproximationInterpolation_eq05988222900342699238.png" %}
</p><p>approximates our function. A basic strategy to achieve this is through least squares, where we minimize the functional

 the target function values and 
  {% include inline_image.html file="S2FunApproximationInterpolation_eq17152385268655187882.png" %}
 our approximation evaluated in the given data nodes.</p><p>This can be done by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lsqr</code> function of Matlab, which efficiently seeks for roots of the derivative of the given functional (also known as normal equation). In the process we compute the matrix-vector product with the Fourier-matrix multible times, where the Fourier-matrix is given by</p><p>

</p><p>This matrix-vector product can be computed efficiently with the use of the nonequispaced spherical Fourier transform <a href="https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/nfsft.php">NFSFT</a>.</p><p>We end up with the Fourier-coefficients of our approximation
