-------
    - This <span class="keyword">function</span> is mainly <span class="string">for</span> <span class="string">efficient</span> <span class="string">sampling</span> <span class="string">in</span> <span class="string">non-uniform</span>
      distribution, which <span class="string">can</span> <span class="string">be</span> <span class="string">either</span> <span class="string">parametric</span> <span class="string">or</span> <span class="string">non-parametric.</span>
</pre><pre>     - The function is implemented based on histc, which has been
       highly optimized by mathworks. The basic idea is to divide
       the range [0, 1] into K bins, with the length of each bin
       proportional to the probability mass. And then, n values are
       drawn from a uniform distribution in [0, 1], and the bins that
       these values fall into are picked as results.</pre><pre>     - This function can also be employed for continuous distribution
       in 1D/2D dimensional space, where the distribution can be
       effectively discretized.</pre><pre>     - This function can also be useful for sampling from distributions
       which can be considered as weighted sum of "modes".
       In this type of applications, you can first randomly choose
       a mode, and then sample from that mode. The process of choosing
       a mode according to the weights can be accomplished with this
       function.</pre><!--/introduction--><h2 id="1">View Code</h2><h2 id="2">Syntax</h2><p>
