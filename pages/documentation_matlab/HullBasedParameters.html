{% highlight matlab %}
% import the artificial grain shapes
mtexdata testgrains silent

% select and smooth a few interesting grains
grains = smooth(grains('id',[2 3 9 11 15 16 18 23 31 33 38 40]),3);
{% endhighlight %}
<p><a href="grain2d.smooth.html">Smoothing</a> of grains is necessary since otherwise many grain segments are either vertical or horizontal (for a square grid) and perimeters rather measure the "cityblock" distance. See also <a href="https://t.co/1vQ3SR8noy?amp=1">https://t.co/1vQ3SR8noy?amp=1</a> for examples. Note, that for very small grains, the error between the smoothed grains and their convex hull may lead to unsatisfactory results.</p><p>The convex hull of a list of grains can be computed by the command <a href="grain2d.hull.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hull</code></a>. The result is a list of convex grains which can be analyzed almost analogously like the original list of grains.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
% compute convex hull grains
chGrains = grains.hull;

% plot the original grains
plot(grains,'micronbar','off'), legend off

% and on top of them the convex hull
hold on
plot(chGrains.boundary,'lineWidth',2,'lineColor','r')
hold off

</center><p>One major difference is that grains may now overlap but their convex hulls usually do. Accordingly, the boundaries of the convex hull grains are not a boundaries between adjecent grains and, therefore, the second phase in all convex hull boundary segments is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'notIndexed'</code>.</p><h2 id="4">Deviation from fully convex shapes</h2><p>There are various measures to describe the deviation from fully convex shapes, i.e. the lobateness of grains. Many of these are based on the differences between the convex hull of the grain and the grain itself. Depending on the type of deviation from the fully convex shape, some measures might be more appropriate over others.</p><p>One measure is the relative difference between the grain perimeter and the perimeter of the convex hull. It most strongly discriminizes grains with thin, narrow indenting parts, e.g. fracture which not entirely dissect a grain.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
deltaP = 100 * (grains.perimeter-chGrains.perimeter) ./ grains.perimeter;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>A similar measure is the <a href="grain2d.paris.html">paris</a> which stands for Percentile Average Relative Indented Surface and gives the difference between the actual perimeter and the perimeter of the convex hull, relative to the convex hull.</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
paris = 200 * (grains.perimeter - chGrains.perimeter) ./ chGrains.perimeter;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The relative difference between the grain area and the area within the convex hull is more indicative for a broad lobateness of grains</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
deltaA = 100 * (chGrains.area - grains.area) ./ chGrains.area;
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The total deviation from the fully convex shape can be expressed by</p>
{% highlight matlab %}
radiusD = sqrt(deltaP.^2 + deltaA.^2);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Lets visualize all these shape parameters in one plot</p>
