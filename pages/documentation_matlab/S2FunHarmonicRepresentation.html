    edit page</a></font><div><!--introduction--><!--/introduction--><p>Similarly as periodic functions may be represented as weighted sums of sines and cosines a spherical function \(f\) can be written as series of the form</p><p>\[ f(\bf x) = \sum_{m=0}^M \sum_{l = -m}^m \hat f(m,l) Y_{m,l}(\bf x) \]</p><p>with respect to Fouriers coefficients \(\hat f(m,l)\) and the so called spherical harmonics \(Y_{m,l}(\bf x)\).</p><p>In terms of polar coordinates \(\bf x = (\sin \theta \cos \rho, \sin \theta \sin \rho, \cos \theta)\) the spherical harmonic of degree \(m\) and order \(l\) is defined by</p><p>\[ Y_{m,l}(\theta, \rho) = \sqrt{\frac{2m+1}{4\pi}}P_{m,|l|}(\cos\rho)\mathrm e^{\mathrm i l\theta} \]</p><p>where \(P_{m,|l|}\), \(m \in\bf N_0\), and \( <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l</code> \le m\) denote the associated Legendre-Polynomials.</p><p>Within the class <a href="S2FunHarmonic.S2FunHarmonic"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">S2FunHarmonic</code></a> spherical function are stored by their Fourier coefficients. In particular all operation on those functions are implmented as operations on the Fourier coefficients.</p><p>The crucial parameter when representing spherical functions by their harmonic series expansion is the harmonic cut off degree \(M\). As a rule of thumb: smooth functions require only a small cut off degree whereas functions with jumps or sharp edges requires a high cut off degree. If the cut off degree is choosen to small truncation error in the form of high order oscillations are observable. The robust estimation of these Fourier coefficients from discrete data is doiscussed in the secion <a href="S2FunApproximationInterpolation.html">Spherical Approximation</a>.</p><p>If you think you remember these from the Windows 2000 flowerbox screensaver, you are wrong. But they play a fundamental role in the computation of atomic orbital electron configurations and may have appeared in a chemistry book you've seen.</p><p>Now we seek for so-called Fourier-coefficients \(\bf{\hat f} = (\hat f_{0,0},\dots,\hat f_{M,M})^T\) such that</p><p>\[ g(x) = \sum_{m=0}^M\sum_{l = -m}^m \hat f_{m,l} Y_{m,l}(x) \]</p><p>approximates our function. A basic strategy to achieve this is through least squares, where we minimize the functional \[ \sum_{n=1}^N|f(x_n)-g(x_n)|^2 \]</p><p>for the data nodes \(x_n\), \(n=1,\dots,N\), \(f(x_n)\) the target function values and \(g(x_n)\) our approximation evaluated in the given data nodes.</p><p>This can be done by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lsqr</code> function of Matlab, which efficiently seeks for roots of the derivative of the given functional (also known as normal equation). In the process we compute the matrix-vector product with the Fourier-matrix multible times, where the Fourier-matrix is given by</p><p>\[ F = [Y_{m,l}(x_n)]_{n = 1,\dots,N;m = 0,\dots,M,l = -m,\dots,m}. \]</p><p>This matrix-vector product can be computed efficiently with the use of the nonequispaced spherical Fourier transform <a href="https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/nfsft.php">NFSFT</a>.</p><p>We end up with the Fourier-coefficients of our approximation \(g\), which describe our approximation.</p><p>There are other variants to obtain these Fourier-coefficients, but we only wanted to give a feel for what they are for.</p><p>To concluse this session we plot the first ten spherical harmonics</p>
